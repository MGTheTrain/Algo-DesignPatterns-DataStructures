## Summary

Curated list of design patterns, data structures, array sorting algorithms and their use cases

## References

- [Space and time Big-O complexities of common algorithms](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com)

## Features

- [ ] Coding design patterns for design principles (e.g. SOLID) and their use cases
- [ ] Efficient array sorting algorithms in terms of complexity 
- [ ] Basic data structures including their common operations (insertion, deletion, search) and associated complexities along with practical applications

## Getting started

### Preconditions

- If your IDE supports it, install [Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- **(Optionally)** Download a [Python Release](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a [CMake release](https://cmake.org/download/) 
- `make` cli tool

**NOTE:** On Windows you would preferably utilize the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
