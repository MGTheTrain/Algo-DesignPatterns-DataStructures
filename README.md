Curated list of design patterns, data structures, sort algorithms and their use cases

### Data Structure operations and their complexities

| Data Structure      | Operation   | Time Complexity (Average / Worst Case) |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Binary Tree         | Insertion   | O(log n) / O(n)                        |
|                     | Deletion    | O(log n) / O(n)                        |
|                     | Search      | O(log n) / O(n)                        |
| Dynamic Arrays      | Insertion   | O(1) (amortized) / O(n)                |
|                     | Deletion    | O(1) (amortized) / O(n)                |
|                     | Search      | O(n)                                   |

|                     | Search      | O(1)                                   |
| Linked List         | Insertion   | O(1)                                   |
|                     | Deletion    | O(1)                                   |
